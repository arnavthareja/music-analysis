# Popular Music Analysis (Work in progress)  

An analysis of popular music  

## Methodology  

Data is retrieved using the Spotify API, stored in a csv file, and visualized using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn  

## To Do:  

- Annotate Jupyter Notebooks and add analysis for each individual feature for all, popular, and "unpopular" songs  
- Machine Learning model to predict a sample's popularity based on its other features
- Machine Learning model to predict a certain value for a feature given other feature values
- Improve documentation
- Create requirements.txt (pip) and environment.yml (conda) to easily copy environment between machines
- Explain how to set Spotify API credentials using environment variables or in the Jupyter Notebook
